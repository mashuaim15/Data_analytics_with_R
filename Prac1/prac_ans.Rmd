This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
tinytex::install_tinytex()
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
setwd("/Users/Brian/desktop/R/lab1")
csdata <- read.csv("dataSTR.csv")
head(csdata)
tail(csdata)
summary(csdata)
```
# create a subset of the original dataset
```{r}
cssub <- subset(csdata, select=c("testscr","str"))
summary(cssub)
require(ggplot2)
```
# visualize the data in R, here we are trying to find the relationship b/w testscr(testscore) and str(student to teach ratio)
```{r}
qplot(testscr, data=cssub, bins=35)
ggsave("testscr_plot.pdf")
```
```{r}
qplot(str, data=cssub, bins=35)
ggsave("str_plot.pdf")
```
#plot tow variables together , form a scatterplot
```{r}
qplot(str, testscr, data=cssub)
ggsave("str_testscr_scatterplot.pdf")
```
# fitting a straight line in the scatterplot
```{r}
ggplot(cssub, aes(str, testscr))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method="lm")
```
#Fit a line, linear~regression model
```{r}
Lm <- lm(testscr~str, data=cssub)
summary(Lm)
```
# Conclusion:
# Using this model, we find that:
# 1. increasing the student-teacher-ratio...
#    ceteris paribus, reduces the performance in terms of
#    the average 5th grade test score.
# 2. Our best estimate is that, if str increases by one,
#    we expect performance to fall by -2.2.
#    Remember that test scores were between 600 and 700.
#
# Remember:
# 3. We have no idea where these numbers come from
# 4. We did not involve any other variables
# 5. We have assumed linearity (and a lot more!)
